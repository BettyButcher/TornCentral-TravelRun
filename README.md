# TornCentral-TravelRun
TravelRun is used with the website Torn.com and allows players to track and update items that not sold in the city.

It is a simple copy/paste and the updated information is posted to the website.

We are going to call this v1p1 since we have not changed much, but we are working on more!

v1p1: In the old Git there was a pull request to json support, so that was added you can access the file here:
